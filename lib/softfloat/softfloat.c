| number either with one integer bit and 31 fraction bits or with two integer
| bits and 30 fraction bits.  The format of 'a' is determined by 'oddExpA',
| which must be either 0 or 1.  If 'oddExpA' is 1, 'a' is interpreted as
| having one integer bit, and if 'oddExpA' is 0, 'a' is interpreted as having
| two integer bits.  The 'a' input must be "normalized", meaning that its
| most-significant bit (bit 31) must be 1.  Thus, if A is the value of the
| fixed-point interpretation of 'a', it follows that 1 <= A < 2 when 'oddExpA'
| is 1, and 2 <= A < 4 when 'oddExpA' is 0.
|   The returned value is interpreted as a pure unsigned fraction, having
| no integer bits and 32 fraction bits.  The approximation returned is never
| greater than the true reciprocal 1/sqrt(A), and it differs from the true
| reciprocal by at most 2.06 ulp (units in the last place).  The approximation
| returned is also always within the range 0.5 to 1; thus, the most-
